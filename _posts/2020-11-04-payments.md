One of the vital functions of cryptocurrency is the permission of decentralized and trustless transfer of value among two parties. As DeFi continues to grow, more and more creative methods of payments are being innovated and tested.

One such DeFi project (subsequently discussed) seeks to change the payment system by having them reconfigured as streams rather than the familiar transactions. 

With payment streams, there is a possible overabundance of potential money applications. Picture “pay-as-you-use” but on a scale far more granular with improved accuracy.

The cradle of DeFi as well as the rate of innovation will no doubt bring about new thinking patterns on the working of payments to tackle many of the shortfalls of the present financial system.
