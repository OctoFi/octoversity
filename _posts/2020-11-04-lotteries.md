With the evolution of DeFi, we will see the emergence of creative and unsettling financial applications which will democratize accessibility and remove intermediaries.

Equipping lotteries with a DeFi spin enables the removal of supervision of the pooled capital on a smart contract in the Ethereum Blockchain.

With the flexibility of DeFi, a simple lottery Dapp can be linked with yet another DeFi Dapp for more value creation. A DeFi Dapp which we will discuss subsequently allows users to pool their capital as one. 

This pooled capital is in turn invested in a DeFi lending Dapp and the returning interest is offered to a random winner at a particular interval. After the winner has been picked, all lottery tickets are refunded to their respective purchasers, guaranteeing zero loss to all users.
