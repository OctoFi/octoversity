While there are many benefits of a blockchain, there are also several drawbacks associated with decentralized applications (Dapps):

- **Immutability:** Since smart contracts are programmed by humans, its effectiveness can only be as good as whoever programmed it. Human errors cannot be avoided and immutable smart contracts can further complicate errors into something much bigger.
- **Scalability:** Usually, the Dapp bandwidth is restricted to its associated blockchain.
- **Transparent:** Smart contracts that are openly auditable can as well lure hackers who can access the code to detect exploits.
