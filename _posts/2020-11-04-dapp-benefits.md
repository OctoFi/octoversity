Decentralized applications (Dapps) are hosted on decentralized systems such as Ethereum and typically have these benefits:

 - **Immutability:** Upon entering the blockchain, no information can be changed.
 - **Transparent:** Smart contracts enabling Dapps can be audited openly.
 - **Tamper-proof:** Tampering of smart contracts on the blockchain will alert all participants therein.
 - **Availability:** Dapps will always be active and usable as long as the Ethereum system remains active.
